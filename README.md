# Overview

This program is an iOS application that allows you to make simple artwork and save it to their photo library. There are other buttons that allow you to clear the drawing canvas, change the color of the drawing tool, and change the drawing tool's width. The "plus" button in the menu bar expands the ink color options from 4 to 12; likewise, it can then be minimized by pressing the "minus" button.

One purpose of making this program was to create something that interests me; I am an artist and have used iOS apps that are similar to this one. Another purpose of making this program was to challenge myself with a programming language that was relatively new and everchanging. Many of the resources on the internet for learning Swift were out of date or unhelpful, so I had to be extra careful in learning how to sufficiently understand the language.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* Add the ability to toggle the pen type rather than just the width
* Adjust the fonts to be better sizes and more visually interesting
